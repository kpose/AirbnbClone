## Installation and Setup Instructions

You will need Node, Watchman, and the React Native command line interface. I recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew: `brew install node` and `brew install watchman`. If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 10 or newer.

#### Project Setup

1. Download / Clone the code: `git clone https://github.com/kpose/AirbnbClone.git`
2. Open the project root directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. CD into ios directory and run `pod install` to install all pods
4. Run `npx react-native start` inside the project folder to start React Native Metro Bundler
5. Open a new terminal inside the project folder. Run the following: `npx react-native run-ios`
   You should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.
